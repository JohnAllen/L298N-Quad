# L298N-Quad

NOTE: I am not responsible for the effects of this software.  Please ensure you have your motors and power supplies wired correctly before using this.  There are a few different ways you could burn up your Pi or house!  No warranties are expressed or implied for this software.  Feel free to use it.

These three files provide simple one line commands to forward,reverse and stop four motors driven by the L298N **QUAD** H-Bridge motor controller once they are compiled.  

They depend on the GPIO [wiringPi library](https://projects.drogon.net/raspberry-pi/wiringpi/).  You must have that installed.
